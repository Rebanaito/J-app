# J-app
Japanese dictionary/learning app

Simple Japanese-English dictionary app for a Linux terminal. More functionality (GUI version for different systems, mobile app, web app, word-learning capabilities, etc.) to come, so stay tuned!

Application already supports word search for English, both kanas (hiragana and katakana), and Kanji.

To use it, one has to either use 'go run main.go' or build a binary by using 'go build main.go' and launch said binary.

When launched, it will take a second or two to initialize, after which it will prompt the user to provide the search query.
